# ðŸš€ Solder wetting Analysis using Detectron2

This repository contains code and example images for wetting analysis using Detectron2 for molten solder detection and segmentation.

### Aim: 
- Train a model using time lapses of images taken on a hot-stage on laser textured and grit roughened Ag.
- To use standard python libraries on the segmented images to produce shape descriptors and track solder spreading.
- To access the model created (accuracy, precision...)
